        "Dating apps match millions of people daily, but how do they decide who is compatible?  \n",
        "In this project, I explore whether machine learning can simulate the logic of dating platforms like OkCupid not based on behavior or chat data, but on the kinds of profile traits users often filter for: diet, education, religion, and lifestyle choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using a cleaned subset of publicly available OkCupid data, I selected seven categorical traits commonly used in dating filters (`diet`, `drinks`, `smokes`, `education`, `body_type`, `pets`, and `religion`). These traits were used to generate all possible user pairs and measure how similar or different they are across values.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project then applies two core machine learning tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regression**: to predict a continuous compatibility score between user pairs, based on their trait differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Classification**: to predict whether a pair is a “match,” defined as falling within the top 10% of all compatibility scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Across both tasks, I use baseline interpretable models (Linear and Logistic Regression) as well as regularized or nonlinear alternatives (Ridge Regression and Random Forest). Evaluation includes standard metrics (MAE, RMSE, R², Accuracy, F1-score, AUC) and trait-level case studies to assess whether the models are learning meaningful patterns or simply reacting to encoded values.\n",
        "\n",
        "By framing compatibility as a function of trait similarity, this project aims to simulate a structured, interpretable matchmaking system — one that mimics the filtering logic behind dating apps, without relying on swiping or user behavior.\n"

In some cases, they returned false positives when users were similar on most traits but had significant differences in sensitive ones like religion. This aligns with their higher recall but lower precision.\n",

        "- **Random Forest** was more conservative. It failed to identify several true matches that had only minor trait differences particularly in numerically distant but semantically similar values (e.g., religion = 15 vs 20). These false negatives reflect the model's stricter decision boundary and highlight a limitation of working with encoded categorical traits.\n",

        "This project set out to explore whether machine learning models can simulate the logic of matchmaking on dating platforms using interpretable, trait-based data. Rather than relying on behavioral signals like swipes or messages, we focused on seven categorical traits that dating apps often use for filtering: diet, drinks, smokes, education, body type, pets, and religion.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the regression task, we predicted a continuous compatibility score for user pairs. Random Forest Regressor significantly outperformed linear models, and case studies confirmed that it surfaced matches that were both accurate and interpretable — especially when users aligned on high-weighted traits like religion and education.\n",

        "In the classification task, we framed matching as a binary prediction problem. While all models achieved similar AUC scores (~0.81), they differed in how they made decisions:\n",
        "- Logistic Regression was more exploratory, catching more matches but also more false positives.\n",
        "- Naive Bayes was highly selective, favoring precision but missing many viable matches.\n",
        "- Random Forest struck a balance, making confident and mostly accurate decisions, though it occasionally missed true matches due to encoding issues with categorical variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Trait-level case studies brought nuance to these results, showing how different models reacted to the same user profiles. These examples reinforced a central finding: **the quality of a match prediction isn't just about accuracy, it's about alignment with real human preferences and values.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrated that even with limited profile data, it is possible to build interpretable systems that mimic the logic behind compatibility scoring. Future work could:\n",

        "- Integrate user-defined preferences, not just profile similarity\n",
        "- Incorporate behavioral or temporal signals to model evolving preferences\n",
